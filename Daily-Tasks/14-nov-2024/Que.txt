Que 4 : A Hierarchical Model ohasFurf Animals
========================================

Scenario Description:

In a virtual zoo management system, you need to organize and categorize various 
types of animals to efficiently manage their characteristics and behaviors. 
To achieve this, you decide to implement a class hierarchy using multilevel inheritance.

1. Create the Animal Class
Requirements:
Define a private String attribute named name.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name.
Implement getter and setter methods for name.
Create a method to display the animal's details.

2. Create the Mammal Class
Requirements:
Extend the Animal class.
Add a private boolean attribute named .
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name (from Animal) and hasFur.
Implement getter and setter methods for hasFur.
Override the displayDetails method to include information about fur.

3. Create the Dog Class
Requirements:
Extend the Mammal class.
Add a private String attribute named breed.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name, hasFur (from Mammal), and breed.
Implement getter and setter methods for breed.
Override the displayDetails method to include information about the breed.

4. Create the Main Class
Requirements:
Create an instance of the Dog class.
Display details of the Dog object to demonstrate inheritance.


Condition :
-----------
if any numeric value is zero or negative then print "Error Invalid Input".


TEST CASE 1 :
-------------
sample input  : When your reading numeric values for any above Classe then make sure
 if any numeric value is <=0 then print "Error Invalid Input".
                
sample output : Error Invalid Input



TEST CASE 2 :
-------------
sample input : Dog myDog = new Dog("Buddy", true, "Golden Retriever");
               
sample output : 
               Dog Details:
               Animal Name: Buddy
               Has Fur: Yes
               Breed: Golden Retriever

Que 5 : Ticket Management System with VIP and Student Tickets
============================================================= 

You have been hired by an event management company to develop a ticketing system that can manage different types of tickets for various events. 
The system needs to handle regular tickets, VIP tickets with special access privileges, and student tickets that may have a discount. 
Your task is to create a Java program with the following requirements: 

Design a Ticket class with attributes like event name, seat number, and price.

1.Create a class Ticket
------------------------

Instance variable:-

String eventName,private

int seatNumber,private

double price,private

Create a parameterized constructor for all Instance variable to initialize the variable.

Generate Getters and setters for all Instance variable to get values and set values.


2.Create another class VIPTicket and inherit Ticket class here.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Instance variable:-

String specialAccess,private

Create a parameterized constructor for Instance variable to initialize the variable.

//Use super keyword to initialize Ticket class constructor attributes.

Generate Getters and setters for Instance variable to get values and set values.


3.Create another class StudentTicket and inherit Ticket class here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Instance variable:-

boolean studentDiscount,private

Create a parameterized constructor for Instance variable to initialize the variable.

//Use super keyword to initialize Ticket class constructor attributes.

Generate Getters and setters for Instance variable to get values and set values.

Create a class MainTicket which contains main method to demonstrate the usage.

//Creating a Ticket object using the parameterized constructor

//Creating a VIPTicket object using the parameterized constructor

//Creating a StudentTicket object using the parameterized constructor


Condition :
-----------
if any numeric value is zero or negative then print "Error Invalid Input".


TEST CASE 1 :
-------------
sample input  : When your reading values for Ticket class OR VIPTicket OR StudentTicket then make sure if any numeric value is <=0 then print "Error Invalid Input".
                
sample output : Error Invalid Input



TEST CASE 2 :
-------------
sample input  : 
                  Ticket regularTicket = new Ticket("Concert", 101, 50.0);
                  VIPTicket vipTicket = new VIPTicket("VIP Concert", 201, 100.0, "Backstage Access");
                  StudentTicket studentTicket = new StudentTicket("Student Event", 301, 30.0, true);

sample output : 
                Regular Ticket:
                Event: Concert
                Seat Number: 101
                Price: $50.0
                
                VIP Ticket:
                Event: VIP Concert
                Seat Number: 201
                Price: $100.0
                Special Access: Backstage Access
                
                Student Ticket:
                Event: Student Event
                Seat Number: 301
                Price: $30.0
                Student Discount: true

Que 6 : Student Fee Management System
============================================================= 

-> A university needs an efficient way to manage and process fees for its students. There are different types of students with varying fee structures. 
   The university wants a system to handle the following scenarios:

1) Regular Students: Students who only need to pay the exam fee. This is the base class scenario.

2) Day Scholars: Students who attend classes daily but do not stay in hostels. They have an additional transport fee on top of the exam fee. This fee needs to be managed and calculated separately.

3) Hostellers: Students who stay in university hostels and have additional hostel fees. Their total fee is the sum of the exam fee and hostel fee.


Create BLC class as Student  
---------------------------
It contains the following implementation.

Instance Variables: studentId : int , name :String , examFee:double

Methods: displayDetails(): String , payFee() :double

Define parameterized constructor and a toString method.

Create two BLC sub classes of Student called DayScholar and Hosteller. 
Add the following implementations to each class.

DayScholar:
-----------

Instance Variables : transportFee:double ,

Methods: Define parameterized constructor 


Hosteller:
----------
Instance Variables: hostelFee :double

Methods: Define parameterized constructor 

Add the following methods in BOTH classes.

Method: displayDetails(): This method should return a string containing the details of the student

in the following format:

Student [name=John Smith,studentId=123,examFee=100.0] OR

DayScholar[transportFee=500, name=John Smith,studentId=123,examFee=100.0] and so on.

Method: payFee(amount): This method takes amount as parameter that represents the fee

provided. You must calculate and then return the remaining amount paid in excess. If excess is

paid, the returned amount will be negative. The total fees that each student must pay must

include all the fees applicable to that Student(examFees, transportFees, hostelFees as applicable).

Subtract the given amount from total fee for each student and return the remaining amount.


An ELC class Tester is given to you with a main method. Use this class to test your solution's

classes and methods.


Condition :
-----------
if any numeric value is zero or negative then print "Error Invalid Input".


TEST CASE 1 :
-------------
sample input  : When your reading values for Student class OR DayScholar Class OR Hosteller Class then make sure if any numeric value is <=0 then print "Error Invalid Input".
                
sample output : Error Invalid Input


TEST CASE 2 :
-------------
sample input  : 
                 1. For Student Class:
                 studentId: 1
                 name: "John Smith"
                 examFee: 25000.0
                 Payment Amount: 25000.0

                 2. For DayScholar Class:
                 studentId: 2
                 name: "Brian Lara"
                 examFee: 25000.0
                 transportFee: 5000.0
                 Payment Amount: 37000.0

                 3. For Hosteller Class:
                 studentId: 3
                 name: "Virat Kohli"
                 examFee: 25000.0
                 hostelFee: 8000.0
                 Payment Amount: 33000.0

sample output : 

                 Student[name=John Smith,studentId=1,examFee=25000.0]
                 All Fees are clear
                 
                 DayScholar[TransportFee=5000.0,name=Brian Lara,studentId=2,examFee=25000.0]
                 Remaining amount to pay is: 12000.0
                 
                 Hosteller[HostelFee=8000.0,name=Virat Kohli,studentId=3,examFee=25000.0]
                 All Fees are clear
