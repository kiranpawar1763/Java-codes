1)
You are tasked with modeling a simple banking system using Java classes. Implement three classes: BankAccount, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount.

BankAccount Class:

Attributes:

int accountNumber: Represents the account number.
double balance: Represents the current balance in the account.

create Parametrized constructor to initialize Instance Variables

Methods:-

1)method name:- deposite
Return Type:- void
parameter: double amount
this method Adds the specified amount to the balance.

2)method name:- withdraw
Return Type:- void
parameter: double amount

Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if sufficient funds are available; otherwise, prints "Insufficient funds."

SavingAccount class:-

extends from BankAccount.

Additional Attributes:
double interestRate: Represents the interest rate for the savings account.

create Parametrized constructor to initialize Instance Variables


Methods:-

1)method name:- addInterest
Return Type:- void
parameter: NO
this method Adds interest to the balance based on the interest rate.

CheckingAccount Class:

extends from BankAccount.

Additional Attributes:

double overdraftLimit: Represents the overdraft limit for the checking account.//3000

create Parametrized constructor to initialize Instance Variables

Methods:-

void withdraw(double amount): Subtracts the specified amount from the balance if it does not exceed the overdraft limit(3000); otherwise, prints "Exceeds overdraft limit."

2)Problem: Online Shopping System

You are building an Online Shopping System, and you need to create a class hierarchy to represent different types of products that customers can purchase. You will be implementing a set of classes that model the products and their attributes. The focus of this problem is to demonstrate the use of inheritance and method overriding in Java.

Follow the provided code as a base, and create the necessary classes to satisfy the requirements below:

  Create a class named Product:

    It should have protected instance variables name (String) and price (double).
    Implement a constructor that initializes the name and price.
    Define a method displayInfo() that prints the product's name and price.
    Define a method calculateTotalCost(int quantity) that calculates and returns the total cost of purchasing a given quantity of the product.

  Create a subclass named Electronics:
    Extend the Product class.

    Add a private instance variable brand (String).
    Implement a constructor that takes name, price, and brand as parameters and initializes the superclass constructor.
    Define a method displayInfo() method to additionally print the product's brand.

  Create another subclass named Clothing:
    Extend the Product class.

    Add a private instance variable size (String).
    Implement a constructor that takes name, price, and size as parameters and initializes the superclass constructor.
    Define a method displayInfo() method to additionally print the product's size.

  Create a class named OnlineShopping (as provided in the code):

    In the main method, create instances of both Electronics and Clothing with appropriate values.
    Print information about each product, including their specific attributes.
    Calculate and print the total cost for a given quantity of each product.

Your task is to implement the required classes based on the provided problem description. This will help you practice inheritance concepts.
